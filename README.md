# Deep feed forward based neural network prediction model

Predicting the load loss and blackout of a 20 component electrical system using neuraql network.\
The prediction has two parts:\
1)Blackout prediction: Predict a binary output, 1 representing complete system blackout and 0, representing no blackout.\
2)Load loss estimation: Estimating the load loss of the system.
